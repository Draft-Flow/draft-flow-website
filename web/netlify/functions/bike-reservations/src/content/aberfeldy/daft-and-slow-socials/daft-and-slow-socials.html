A daft and slow social ride during the warmer/lighter months, happening on the 1st and 3rd Wednesday evening of the month during the brighter months of the year. The route varies from week to week but typically involves a mix of terrain - from tarmac to gravel and some singletrack - usually suitable for riders of all abilities. And generally slow-paced to allow for socializing.
