  <li>We encourage members to help each other, but please ask if someone would like assistance before helping</li>

  <li>Members should not represent themselves as Draft & Flow employees or volunteers unless they are an employee or volunteer</li>
  <li>Members may not operate any business out of Draft & Flow workshop.
