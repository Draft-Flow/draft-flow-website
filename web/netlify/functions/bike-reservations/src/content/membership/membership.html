Becoming a member of the Community Cycle Workshop supports our aim to provide accessible cycle servicing and get more people riding bikes. Plus, membership provides you with benefits. Draft & Flow is a registered Community Interest Company (CIC) and all profits are reinvested into the improving our cycle services and local cycling initiatives.
