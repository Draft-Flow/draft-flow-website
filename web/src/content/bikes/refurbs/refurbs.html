_**Bikes for the community**_

Our community up-cycle programme gives old bikes a new life with the goal to get more people using bikes for everyday travel in Aberfeldy. From Grandtully to Kenmore, the Upper Tay Valley is a great place to use a bike for trips to the shops, visiting friends, getting outdoors, and more. And cycling helps Aberfeldy become [Scotland's Healthiest Town](https://www.healthiesttown.org/). 

Our programme has 3 steps:
<ul class="grid md:grid-cols-3 text-center text-lg gap-6 list-none">
<li>
  <div class="font-bold text-xl">Donate 'em</div>
  Donate your old/unused bikes - even if they're broken we can use many of the parts
</li>
<li>
  <div class="font-bold text-xl">Fix 'em</div>
  We'll do any necessary maintenance/fixes and ensure they're safe to ride (at no charge)
</li>
<li>
  <div class="font-bold text-xl">Ride 'em</div>
  The bikes will be donated or sold at minimal cost for use in the community
</li>
</ul>

We usually have a selection of refurbed bikes available for purchase, or short-term use. Pop into the workshop (or just peer through window) to view our current offering.
