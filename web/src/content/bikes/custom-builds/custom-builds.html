_**Build your dream bike**_

Looking for a bike that's all your own? A completely custom bike build is as good as it gets - allowing you to select every part from the rubber to the grips to make a bike perfectly suited for your needs.    

<ul class="grid list-none grid-col-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-8 text-center mb-8">
  <li>
    <div class="font-bold text-xl">Custom Bikes</div>
    Select everything from the frame, wheels and every component. Ideal if you're planning a big trip, need a bike for a specific use, or just want a bike to match your unique style. We work with a range of frame manufacturers, component makers, and parts companies to build your dream machine. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="font-bold text-xl">Custom Wheels</div>
    Looking for a fresh set of wheels to match your bike? Or a burly pair of wheels designed for months of adventure? A custom wheelset is often the only way to go. Check out the <a href="/bike-servicing/upgrades/">brands we work with</a>, or contact us if don't see what you're looking for.
