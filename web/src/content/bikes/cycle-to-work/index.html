_**Save money on your next bike**_

Draft & Flow can now supply bikes through the Cycle to Work scheme. This UK government initiative lets employees purchase a new bike and accessories tax‑free via their employer, paying monthly through salary deductions.

If your workplace offers a Cycle to Work programme, get in touch and we’ll help you choose a bike and submit the paperwork. Unsure how it all works? Pop into the shop or drop us an email—we’re happy to explain the process and answer any questions.

For more information on how the scheme works, see the [official Cycle to Work guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycle-to-work-scheme-implementation-guidance).
