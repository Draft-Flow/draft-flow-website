_**Save money on your next bike**_

Draft & Flow can supply bikes through the Cycle to Work scheme. This UK government initiative lets employees purchase a new bike and accessories tax‑free via their employer, paying monthly through salary deductions. By deducting the cost of the bike from your salary before tax (salary sacrifice), it reduces your taxable income and results in lower tax and National Insurance contributions. 

## How it works
- Employees choose a bike and accessories from participating retailers, and their employer then purchases the equipment. 
- The cost is repaid through monthly deductions from the employee's gross salary (before tax and National Insurance). 
- Because the repayments are made before tax, employees pay less Income Tax and National Insurance, effectively saving them money. 
- While the bike is typically owned by the employer during the repayment period, employees often have the option to purchase it at a fair market value at the end of the agreement. 
- The scheme encourages cycling for commuting, promotes healthier lifestyles, and can lead to significant cost savings on bikes and accessories. 
- The scheme is generally available to all employees, and employers can register to participate. 
- The scheme covers a wide range of bikes (including e-bikes and adapted bikes), cycling clothing, helmets, locks, lights, and other accessories.
