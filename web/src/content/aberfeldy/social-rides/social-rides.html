Riding with others is a great way to meet new people and explore new routes (but we also understand that some people prefer to ride alone). We have a few different type of group rides:

<strong>Social Rides</strong>: organised by community members, happening at various times throughout the year. The routes vary each ride. And the rides are generally slow-paced to allow for socializing. Join our [Social Rides WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/IsTQ9nThuqY8kWxf4XLM4k) to be notified, or subscribe to the [{{ metadata.title }} Flyer](/newsletter).

<strong>Brew with a View</strong>: a monthly meetup at a scenic location for a brew with a view. During the brighter months, we'll announce a location for each meetup, it's up to you to get there using your preferred mode of transport (preferrably mostly human-powered). You can go with others, or go solo, and we'll see you there!
