_**Places to ride, visit, eat, and relax in Aberfeldy**_

Aberfeldy is a mere 30-minutes off the A9, and just 90 minutes north of both Edinburgh and Glasgow. But in a world of it's own, with a variety of riding to suit nearly everyone. With the Cairngorm National Park to the east, and Loch Lomond & The Trossachs to the west, Aberfeldy sits at the southern end of the highlands with access to a wide range of terrain and activities.
