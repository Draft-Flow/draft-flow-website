A daft and slow social ride during the warmer/lighter months, happening on the 1st and 3rd Thursday evening of the month. The route varies from week to week but typically involves a mix of terrain - from tarmac to gravel and some singletrack - but is suitable for riders of all abilities. Generally slow-paced to allow for socializing.
