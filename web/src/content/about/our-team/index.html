    <h6 class="font-bold text-center">Brett De Woody</h6>
    <p>Brett  has served as Trustee of the Birks Cinema for 3+ years, and currently holds the position of Chair of the Board. He has also served on the Board of Highland Perthshire Cycling (promoting cycling in Highland Perthshire), started several computer programming community groups, and volunteered as a mentor to at-risk youth in Dundee. He spends a lot of time behind a computer as a software developer, but is happiest when he's outside, and especially when he's on a bike.
    </p>
    <p>Brett is big fan of big , self-supported bike adventures. He's cycled across the U.S., twice. First at the age of 13 from west to east, then from Canada to Mexico. And across the widest swath of South America, through the Amazon and over the Andes. He's also done bike-rafting trips in Alaska, ridden every mile of road in Yellowstone, and now enjoys exploring the backroads and tracks of Scotland.</p>gl

    <h6 class="font-bold text-center">Calum Maclean</h6>
    <p>Calum's main interest in cycling comes from using a bike as a way to access adventures and places often far from the beaten track. He has ridden multi-day bike tours and multiple triathlons, both on road and trail. He is currently restoring an old Triumph bicycle in the Draft & Flow workshop.</p>
    <p>Calum works as a freelance broadcaster, with much of his work covering adventure sports and the outdoors in Scotland. He previously worked as an outdoor instructor, picking up a bike mechanic qualification (however, he defers to Brett in most technical aspects!) Calum regularly appears on the BBC, working in both his native Gaelic, and English. He is always keen to promote and use the Gaelic language. Ma tha a' Ghàidhlig agad - bruidhinn Gàidhlig ris!</p>

    <h6 class="font-bold text-center">Jerome Mayaud</h6>
    <p>Jerome is currently setting up a programme that harnesses the power of open-water swimming to help children in the Strath Tay area to overcome grief and trauma. He is the scientific coordinator for the Polar Academy, a Scottish charity that takes children through a year of intensive physical and mental training and culminates in a winter sledge haul in Greenland. He is also an impact advisor for Àban, another Scottish charity that offers positive outdoor adventures for young people and families, and serves on the board of Just Wheels, a charity that helps people with physical disabilities in Tanzania in East Africa.</p>
