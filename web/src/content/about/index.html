Draft & Flow started as a home-based bike mechanic service out of Brett DeWoody's kitchen in the fall of 2022. 

Within months it became clear there was demand for bike repair in Aberfeldy but a for-profit shop was not the way forward. As a result, Draft & Flow changed course in late 2023, converted to a [Community Interest Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company), and shifted focus to carry out activities for the benefit of the local community. This means we operate like a bike shop, but with a strong focus on increasing cycle adoption, and reinvest profits back into the local cycling initiatives.

Our aim is to get more people riding, and keep them riding.

This is the aim of the Draft & Flow Community Cycle Workshop, and we offer: 
- Tools for DIY repairs
- Bike repair servicing
- Maintenance courses
- Parts, accessories, and bike sales
- Bike hire
- Riding information and advice
