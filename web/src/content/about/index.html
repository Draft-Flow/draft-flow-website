Draft & Flow started as a home-based bike mechanic service out of Brett DeWoody's kitchen in the fall of 2022. 

It soon became clear there was a big demand for bike repair in Aberfeldy but a for-profit shop was not the way to go. As a result, Draft & Flow changed course in late 2023 and converted to a [Community Interest Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company) and shifted focus to carry out activities for the benefit of the local community. This means we operate like a bike shop, but with a stronger focus on benefitting the community, and any profits are reinvested back into the community. We call this a Community Cycle Workshop. 

The Community Cycle Workshop will offer:
- Tools for DIY repairs
- Bike repair servicing
- Maintenance courses
- Parts, accessories and bike sales
- Bike hire
- Riding information and advice
