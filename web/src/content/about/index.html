Draft & Flow started as a home-based bike mechanic service out of Brett DeWoody's kitchen in the fall of 2022. 

It soon became clear there was a big demand for bike repair in Aberfeldy. As a result Draft & Flow is now changing course. We're joining forces with a few other cycle-minded residents, converting to a Community Interest Company, and setting up a community-centred cycle workshop on Aberfeldy's town square. 

The shop will offer:
- Tools for DIY repairs
- Bike repair servicing
- Maintenance courses
- Parts, accessories and bike sales
- Bike hire
- Riding info

We hope to open our doors in early 2024.
