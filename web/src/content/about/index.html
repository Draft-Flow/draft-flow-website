Draft & Flow started as a home-based bike mechanic service out of Brett's kitchen in the fall of 2022. 

Within months it became clear there was demand for bike repair in Aberfeldy but a for-profit shop was not the way forward. As a result, Draft & Flow changed course in late 2023, converted to a [Community Interest Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company), and shifted focus to carry out activities for the benefit of the local community. This means we operate like a bike shop, but with a strong focus on increasing cycle adoption, and reinvest all profits back into the local cycling initiatives.

This is the aim of the Draft & Flow Community Cycle Workshop, and we offer: 
- A dedicated safe space for connecting through cycles and cycle maintenance
- Tools for DIY repairs
- Bike repair servicing
- Maintenance courses
- Parts, accessories, and bike sales
- Riding information and advice
