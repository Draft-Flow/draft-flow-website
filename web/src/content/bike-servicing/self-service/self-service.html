_**A community workspace for DIY bike servicing, learning and training**_

In the works! We're soon moving into a dedicated workshop in Aberfeldy, and planning to outfit it with a variety of tools and equipment you can use for self-servicing. AKA a 'bike kitchen'.

As a Community Interest Company we're committed to positively impacting our community, staff, customers, and our planet. A Bike Kitchen is integral to this as it would provide a space for teaching bike skills and training mechanics.
