_**A community workspace for DIY bike servicing, learning and training**_

The community cycle workshop offers a dedicated space for do-it-yourself fixes with tools, equipment, and bike stands for servicing your bike.

In addition, parts and accessories are available for purchase, and we can provide guidance and assistance as needed (if a mechanic is on-duty).
