_**Take your bike and riding to the next level**_

Looking to upgrade your riding? An update to your bike's components can completely change your riding. A fresh set of wheels or tyres, updated drivetrain, hydraulic brakes, new suspension, bike bags for a big adventure, or even a different handlebar can drastically change how your bike performs. 

We're an official dealer for a [wide range of top bike and outdoor brands](/bike-servicing/upgrades/) and can help with any bike modifications desired. We highly recommend the brands we carry and are more than happy to give honest gear advice.
