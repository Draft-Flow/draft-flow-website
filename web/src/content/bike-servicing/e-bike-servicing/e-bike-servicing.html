  _**Servicing and support for your e-bike**_

  E-bikes have advanced cycling into a new era. They're speedy, eco-friendly and cost-effective modes of transport, and can make ascending the steep hills around Aberfeldy or multiple laps at Glassie much more enjoyable. But e-bikes are also complex machines/computers. Regular servicing of your e-bike is necessary to keep it in top-shape and prevent costly repairs.
