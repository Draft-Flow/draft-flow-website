_**A community workspace for DIY bike servicing, learning and training**_

In the works! We're seeking space for a workshop in Aberfeldy to outfit with a variety of tools and equipment you can use for self-servicing. AKA a 'bike kitchen'.

A long-term goal of ours is to become a [B-Corp](https://bcorporation.uk/) - committed to positively impacting our staff, community, customers, and our planet. A Bike Kitchen is integral to this as it would provide a space for teaching bike skills and training mechanics.

Know of a space that could work? Please [get in touch](/contact/).
