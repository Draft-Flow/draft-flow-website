_**A community workspace for DIY bike servicing, learning and training**_

In the works! We're seeking space for a workshop in Aberfeldy to outfit with a variety of tools and equipment you can use for self-servicing. AKA a 'bike kitchen'.

A long-term goal of ours is to become a social enterprise - committed to positively impacting our staff, community, customers, and our planet. A Bike Kitchen is integral to this as it would provide a space for teaching bike skills and training mechanics.

  <li>Cleaning Supplies</li>
  <li>Spare/Used Parts</li>

</ul>

We are now accepting input, feedback, and ideas on a community workshop/hub. Have your say by completing our quick survey.
