_**A community workspace for DIY bike servicing and learning**_

In the works! We're seeking space for a workshop in Aberfeldy to outfit with a variety of tools and equipment you can use for self-servicing. AKA a 'bike kitchen'.

<ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-8 grid grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-8">
  <li>Basic Tools</li>
  <li>Cleaning Supplies</li>
  <li>Spare/Used Parts</li>
  <li>Assistance</li>
</ul>

Know of a space that could work? Please [get in touch](/contact/).
