# Accessibility statement for {{ metadata.title }}
This accessibility statement applies to {{ metadata.url }}. This website is run by {{ metadata.company.name }}.

Similar to bikes, we want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:
- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand. 

This site contains links to external websites we have no control over, and consequently cannot guarantee sites we link to will be as accessible. We strive to work with businesses that share our goal of accessibility, so if directed to a website that is not accessible, please [contact us](/contact/).

## Feedback and contact information
If you need information on this website in a different format like accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or braille:
- email at {{ metadata.contact.email }}
- our [contact form]({{ metadata.contact.url }})

We will consider all requests and get back to you as soon as possible.

## Reporting accessibility problems with this website
We're always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we're not meeting accessibility requirements, contact us [here]({{ metadata.contact.url }}), or at {{ metadata.contact.email }}.

## Enforcement procedure
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the â€˜accessibility regulations'). If you're not happy with how we respond to your complaint, [contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).
