# Ride Responsibility Statement

Effective Date: {{ page.date.toLocaleString('en-GB', {month: 'short', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'}) }}

Draft & Flow C.I.C. is not able to assume legal responsibility to its members or others.   While we are always keen to share our passion for riding, all riders must be solely responsible for making their own assessment as to the risks involved in any particular ride.

Draft & Flow C.I.C. itself has no control or influence over those who arrange social rides on WhatsApp, Facebook, using the Draft & Flow group or other groups, or the locations of the rides.

The decision to participate in any ride must therefore be taken individually, and riders must not rely (in whole or in part) on views or information provided by Draft & Flow C.I.C. and/or its members. If you are in any doubt about the safety of a ride or your ability to complete it, you should not take part.

Riding outdoors heightens the risk of serious injury or harm. The risks of outdoor riding include (but are not limited to) hypothermia/hyperthermia, personal health conditions, falls or crashes, equipment failure, and/or injury from wildlife, motor vehicles, other riders, or debris on the route. The ‘safety’ of rides varies with the weather, the abilities and knowledge of the rider and over time – changes to the riding routes.

To the maximum extent permitted by law:
- Draft & Flow C.I.C.;
- each individual acting on behalf of Draft & Flow C.I.C.; and
- any person involved in organising a Draft & Flow C.I.C. ride,

exclude any liability for personal injury, death or other harm or loss to its members or any other person or organisation as a result of their negligence or other breach of legal duty.
