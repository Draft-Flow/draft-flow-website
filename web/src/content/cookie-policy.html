## What Are Cookies
Cookies are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your web browsing experience. Cookies are widely used to ‘remember’ you and your preferences, either for a single visit through a ’session cookie’ or for multiple repeat visits using a ‘persistent cookie’, as well as track sites you visit as you browse. They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. This page describes what information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies.

For more general information on cookies see the [Wikipedia article on HTTP Cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie).

## How We Use Cookies
At {{ metadata.title }} we aim to use as few cookies as possible, if any at all. Why? It's not that we're against cookies (the edible variety are essential on a looooong ride), but we believe we can provide a great browsing experience without jeopardizing your privacy. For this reason we set as few (if any at all) 'first party' cookies, and strive for minimal 'third party' cookies, especially those that impact privacy.

## Disabling Cookies
You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of many websites that you visit. Therefore it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.

## The Cookies We Set
When you submit data through a form such as those found on contact pages or comment forms cookies may be set to remember your user details for future correspondence.

Details are provided in tables below, listing various cookies that are set for users of our store.

## How long will cookies remain on my computer or mobile device?
The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies last until you stop browsing and persistent cookies last until they expire or are deleted. Most of the cookies we use are persistent and will expire between 30 minutes and two years from the date they are downloaded to your device. See the section below on how to control cookies for more information on removing them before they expire.

## How to control cookies?
You can control and manage cookies in various ways. Please keep in mind that removing or blocking cookies can negatively impact your user experience and parts of our website may no longer be fully accessible.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can choose whether or not to accept cookies through your browser controls, often found in your browser's “Tools” or “Preferences” menu. For more information on how to modify your browser settings or how to block, manage or filter cookies can be found in your browser's help file or through such sites as: [allaboutcookies.org](https://allaboutcookies.org/).
